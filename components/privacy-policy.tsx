          Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such
          action could affect the availability and functionality of the Site. You may not decline web beacons. However,

        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
        signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>
